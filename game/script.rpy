    "This massive zoo towers over all the other buildings in this bustling urban area."
    "It's like the zoo stands at the center of the entire world."
    "Seriously, it's a kick-ass zoo."
    "\"The Sweetheart Safari\"."
    "It brings in top animals from every ecosystem imaginable. The ultimate zoo…"
    "They say if you come here, your life will be changed forever."
    "There are two things you need to visit this zoo…"
    "One, you have to be an adorable high school student of indistinct gender and sexuality."
    "Two, you have to have fifteen dollars in cash."
    "No ordinary citizen could visit this zoo. The only way in is if you're a cute high school student."
    "Plus, the $15."
    "And standing there at the gate of the ultimate zoo filled with the ultimate animals…"
    "Was me, the ultimate Cutie!"
    
    "After an arduous week at school, I'm taking a well-deserved day off at the zoo."
    "The sun is shining and a cool breeze tickles my skin…what a perfect day."
    "The only thing missing would be someone to share it with."
    "The \"perfect\" day..."
    "Sigh…"
    "You see, I have a secret."
    "I'm already sixteen years old, but I've never dated anyone before."
    "I haven't even gone on a single date!"
    "Most of my friends have already started relationships, while my feelings go unnoticed…"
    "Some days I wonder if I'll ever find love."
    "Maybe I'll find someone cute at the zoo today?"
    "I can see it now:"
    "We cross paths by the dolphin pools."
    "I knock over their ice cream cone by accident, and treat them to a new one."
    "We both stroll through the zoo, chatting and laughing,"
    "Time drifting by as ice cream drips through our fingers…"
    "..."
    "With thoughts of young love bubbling in my chest, I hold my head high and walk through the zoo's front gate."
    "Is today the day I find love?"

    scene bg entrance night

    "Upon entering the zoo, you notice the narrative perspective of the story shift."
    "It feels a bit jarring, but you can still imagine yourself standing there at the gate, regardless of who else might be watching."
    "You spend so much time readjusting that you fail to notice the front gate slamming closed behind you."
    z "Welcome…to your final day off. Hahaha…"
    "You hear a maniacal laugh echo through the zoo."
    "Who could that be?"
    z "Sorry, kid. There won't be any true love for you today! Or ever!"
    "A strange man walks towards you."
    "He looks like your average Zookeeper. Absolutely nothing unique about him."
    "...Except he's speaking to you like he's a deranged supervillain."
    z "People come to the Sweetheart Safari, expecting to find their soulmates amongst the dolphin pools."
    z "Strolling through the zoo, chatting and laughing, time drifting by as ice cream drips through their fingers…."
    z "HA! How pathetic."
    z "I've been watching you, Cutie. Watching you for at least a few hours now."
    z "I've seen how you search for love, yet fail to find any..."
    z "That's why I've taken over this zoo and turned it into an elaborate jail."
    z "You could never find love out there, so perhaps you could find love in here?"
    z "After all, you've got the rest of your life ahead of you! Hahaha!"
    "Who is this mysterious man? How could he have taken over the world's most prestigious zoo?"
    z "If you're wondering just exactly who you're dealing with…the name's \"Zookeeper\"."
    z "Pleased to meet you."
    "And thus…your journey for love took a drastic turn for the worse."
    z "I didn't trap you in here just to have you solve puzzles or commit murders or anything."
    z "I offer you a chance at redemption: Amongst the exhibits are the animals of this zoo."
    z "These lonely creatures have been trapped, much like you are now. That makes you one of them."
    z "…And if you're one of them, then you can most definitely date them."
    z "I challenge you to find a sweetheart in this safari."
    z "If you can find true love (or at least a steady partner), I'll release you."
    "You think this is an odd state of affairs, but if true love (or at least a steady partner) awaits you, you're willing to go along with it."
    z "You have three days to find true love."
    z "If you work extra hard, I'm sure you could squeeze in a date every morning, afternoon, and night…"
    z "But don't think that anyone in this zoo can be won over so easily!"
    z "You'll have to win their affections first in order to get them on a date proper."
    z "So make sure to chat them up before asking them out. This isn't a love-in, you know."
    z "Well…what are you waiting for? Get to dating!!!!"
    "You figure there's no use standing around, especially when there's a vague threat of doom hanging above your head."
    "You head further into the park, unsure of what may come next…"
